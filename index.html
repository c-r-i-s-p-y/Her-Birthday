                <h3>How I Started to Consider You:</h3>
                <p>You were friends with Raheen, and one day you popped into my requests and started responding to my
                    story out of nowhere. You used to tell me that I’m cute <b>[WEIRD]</b>, but it made me blush every
                    time. You were so sweet that I fell for your trap, <b>POOKIE</b>. And it all started on <b>12th
                        DECEMBER 2019</b>. I used to call you Mima back then, <b>THE MIMA ERA</b>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item zoom-in">
                <h3>Our Breakup:</h3>
                <p>Lol, this was so dramatic and cringe, and you did that just before my birthday <b>17th MAY 2020 YOU
                        EVIL BISH.</b> I'll never forgive you for that, but yeah, we were kids. Faiza madam was fighting
                    for you, and my cousin was fighting for me, <b>WTF</b> was going on? We were so dramatic; we had
                    such a cringe conversation I can’t even tell. But still, that breakup went in vain as we’re still
                    together.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item zoom-in">
                <h3>Another Confession: <b>[EID-UL-ADHA 2020]</b></h3>
                <p>I proposed to you again on <b>EID</b> because I lost you just before Eid-ul-Fitr, so I thought I’d
                    <b>GET YOU BACK</b> on Eid-ul-Adha, but you never replied to my proposal. It was quite sad, but now
                    it feels like a <b>JOURNEY</b>, with its ups and downs, twists and turns. Every moment, even the
                    difficult ones, is part of our story, and I’m holding on, believing that this journey will lead us
                    to where we’re meant to be, together.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item zoom-in">
                <h3>Argument: <b>[2nd APRIL 2021]</b></h3>
                <p><b>Okayy...</b> so this was a misunderstanding between us. And maybe you were out of your mind <b>AS
                        ALWAYS</b>. You stopped talking to me, and that triggered me, so I ended up sending you a long
                    paragraph. I enjoyed giving you a good piece of my mind lol. But the time that followed was not
                    enjoyable at all.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item zoom-in">
                <h3>Starting Over: <b>[4th DECEMBER 2021]</b></h3>
                <p>Ahh... 8 months of <b>FALLOUT</b>, and due to Ifrah Baji's efforts, our friendship started once
                    again. We spent <b>8 MONTHS</b> just waiting for each other’s text lol. Prayed a lot that we could
                    be together once again, and here we go... Hoping something like that won’t happen again.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item zoom-in">
                <h3>And Another Confession: <b>[5th NOVEMBER 2022]</b></h3>
                <p>Yeah, so when we started talking again, I never mentioned that I’m still standing where I was. But
                    then there was a situation where I ended conversations with every female. But I wanted you to know
                    what I <b>FEEL</b> and then end it with you too. I asked you if you could be my <b>BETTER HALF</b>,
                    but you asked me to wait till the <b>RIGHT TIME</b>. I was strong enough to do that back then, and
                    we settled on talking twice a month.</p>

    <section class="love-letter-section">
        <h2 class="fade-in">My Love Letter to You</h2>
        <p class="letter-text slide-in">Dear Jiya<br>
            I just want to tell you that... wait, what a poor start to a letter. Anyway, here’s what I truly want to
            say: since the day we met, I’ve never felt anything close to what I feel for you. I can’t quite define this
            feeling, so I call it "love." Love is something I might never fully understand, and that’s why I call you
            "love", that makes more sense than you do "love".

            There are things I don’t particularly like about you, but the things I do like about you shine so much
            brighter—like your nose, for example. If you ever notice my eyes sparkling when I look at you, it’s just
            because of your nose, not because I’m holding back tears. I hope this doesn’t make you insecure about it.

            It’s hard to put into words what I feel for you, and maybe I never truly can. You’re stunning, and every
            time I look at you, you’re even more beautiful than before. Your outfits are always perfect, except that
            you’re a bit too skinny for your own clothes, not gonna lie. I know I’m repeating myself here, but it’s hard
            not to.

            Oh, and one more thing: you’re not older than me, and I’ll only accept that you are when you start acting
            like it. No shame in admitting that. Also, I have some demands from now on, so be careful—my time has come
            to show a bit of attitude. So, here are my demands: First, no boys near you. Second, listen to what I say.
            Third, control your temper. That’s all I’m asking for now; I don’t think it’s too much.

            Your university is about to start, so good luck with that. Work hard and make me proud. I’m already so proud
            of you for what you’re doing. I just want you to stay happy until I show up with my family; then it’ll be my
            job to keep you happy, and I’m sure I will. I’ve already imagined so much with you, and in every scenario,
            you’re happy.

            Shoutout to all those guys who think they’re better than me—Aaron Warner, Hashim Kardar, Salar Sikandar, and
            all those fictional characters you like. It’s funny because they don’t stand a chance against me. They’re
            just figments of someone’s imagination, while I’m real and still better. Whether you admit it or not,
            there’s something different about me. Just remember, you don’t deserve anyone better than me. I’m the limit
            you can’t surpass, and I’m the best you could ever deserve. If you try finding someone better, you’ll only
            end up losing.

            As for me, I don’t want anything better, even though you’re not perfect (and neither am I). I’m fine with
            all your imperfections, except your temper. We both have high temper levels, so it’ll be tough to make
            things work. But while my temper doesn’t work on you, your one sweet sentence can make all my anger
            disappear—though I might still be a little upset. But you don’t listen when you’re angry, so you need to
            work on that. It’ll take time, but I assure you, no matter how long it takes, I’m never giving up on you.
            I’m always here.

            I always hope that what we have will only get better. I know you don’t fully trust me yet—well, me
            neither—but I’m always motivated to win your trust. I try to be better, to become what you want me to be,
            just don’t give me examples; it makes me jealous, and then I go a little crazy. Just tell me simply, and
            that’s it.

            At first, I didn’t know what to write, and now I can’t stop. You mean so much to me, and no matter what, I
            want you in my future. I’ll do my best from here on out. I am doing my best. Let’s hope for a better future.
            I wish you all the happiness in the world, even if we’re not together. I wanted to make your day, but I’m
            late. I hope this makes the rest of your day better.

            Happy Birthday, My Immature, Hot-Headed Princess.<br>
            Loves,</p>
